# Introduction to managing data projects and products

# Introducing Agile and Waterfall methodologies
## Agile

  - Values flexibility, iterative progress, and customer involvement.
  - With Agile, you would split this task into smaller, manageable pieces, or sprints. 
  - Each sprint could involve designing a specific feature, coding it, testing it, and reviewing it with the customer. 
  - This cycle repeats, gradually building up the product while incorporating customer feedback along the way. 
  - Agile is a perfect fit when creating innovative products, where requirements are likely to evolve or when market trends change rapidly.
  - Unpredictable in time and money, quick to respond
  - Maximising the business value, especially the value for users

### Scrum & Kanban
  - Scrum
    - Widely adopted Agile framework, emphasises efficient collaboration and streamlined workflows through specific roles and ceremonies.
    - The scrum master plays a crucial role in facilitating these standups, ensuring that discussions stay on track, distractions are minimised, and team members adhere to the agenda.
     -- Scrum Roles
      - Scrum Master
        - The scrum master acts as a shield, protecting the team from external distractions and noise, thereby enabling them to focus solely on delivering value.

      - Product Owner
        - The product owner serves as a bridge between the technical team and organisational objectives, ensuring alignment and maximising value delivery.

      - Team Member
        - Comprising data scientists, engineers, and analysts, the team members collectively bring diverse skill sets and expertise to the project.

      -- Scrum Ceremonies
         - Sprint planning marks the beginning of a new sprint, during which the team collaboratively defines the sprint goal and selects the tasks to be completed.
         - Daily Standup - brief and focused meeting where team members provide updates on their progress, discuss any impediments, and plan their activities for the day.
         - Sprint review - The sprint review is a collaborative session held at the end of each sprint, where the team presents the completed work to stakeholders and gathers feedback.
         - Sprint retrospective - The sprint retrospective is a reflective meeting where the team reflects on the previous sprint, identifies areas for improvement, and agrees on actionable steps to enhance their processes.
           - Learning from mistakes - During the sprint retrospective, data engineering teams openly discuss successes and failures, extracting insights for improvement, this may involve reflecting on data pipeline performance, quality issues, or challenges encountered in data integration.
           - Creating a supportive culture - The sprint retrospective fosters an environment where data engineers feel safe to admit mistakes and share feedback, this may involve encouraging experimentation and learning without fear of judgement.
           - Driving continuous improvement - Active participation in the sprint retrospective enables data engineering teams to implement insights for ongoing improvement, this may include refining data processing strategies, optimising pipeline efficiency, and embracing collaboration.     

  - Kanban
    - Emphasising visualising work and limiting work in progress (WIP), is particularly beneficial in environments focusing on bug fixes and testing.
    - By visualising tasks on a Kanban board and setting WIP limits, data engineering teams can effectively manage complex workflows, prioritise tasks, and enhance project visibility. 
   
  - 
## Waterfall

  - The process is clear and sequential—there's planning, designing, building, testing, and finally, maintaining.
  - In the waterfall approach, software design follows the gathering of product requirements, followed by implementation and testing. Maintenance continues until the product is decommissioned, with each stage progressing in a sequential order.
  - The Waterfall model is a sequential, linear approach to project management, where each phase (requirements gathering, design, development, testing, and deployment) must be completed before moving on to the next. This structured and predictable nature has made Waterfall a popular choice for traditional software development projects. However, in the context of data engineering, the Waterfall model often falls short.
  - Structured nature, therefore more predictable. Can take longer to implement
  - Optimising the balance of constraints, that is, the management of scope, time, and cost constraints in a project.

 ## Applying Lean and Six Sigma principles
  # Lean
   - Lean is like fitness for your projects – it strengthens your team, improves flexibility, and ensures you're always ready to adapt and perform at your best.
   - Lean is a continuous improvement methodology focused on eliminating waste and optimising processes.
   


  # Six Sigma
   - Data-driven approach aimed at improving quality by reducing variability and defects

  # Lean Six Sigma

   - Define: The objective is clearly defined as reducing inaccuracies in transaction data
   - Measure: Current error rates are measured
   - Analyse: The root causes of data inaccuracies are identified (e.g., incorrect data entry, outdated information)
   - Improve: Solutions are implemented, such as automated data validation checks and regular data quality audits
   - Control: New standards and controls are established to maintain the improved data quality level
   - Benefit: The structured approach leads to significantly reduced inaccuracies, enhancing the effectiveness of fraud detection algorithms. This results in reduced operational losses and improved customer trust

  
   - Lean methodologies encourage the elimination of non-value-adding activities and focus on streamlining processes. 
   - In the context of identifying data sources and understanding data processing concepts and methods, Lean can facilitate quicker and more efficient decision-making regarding which data sources to prioritise and which data processing methods are most efficient for the task at hand. 
   - Six Sigma adds to this by using data-driven techniques to identify variances in data quality and processing efficiency, allowing for a more precise selection of data sources and methodologies.
