## Building a Data driven Culture
1. Build Relationships for engagement with key stakeholders
2. Transparency in Algorithms
   - Simplify complex models & educate on function initially to gain acceptance
3. Celebrate & embrace small wins
   - Wins can prove value and persuade sceptical stakeholders of worth
4. Raise Data literacy
  - pivotal for sustained adoption of a data-driven culture
  - equips personnel with the requisite skills to navigate data-related endeavours effectively
  - Support for additional training comes from demonstrating value from small wins
## Transitioning to Big Data
1. Reasons
  - Inadequate current tools for increase in volume of data
  - Current systems struggle to process the volume of data
  - Missed opportunities to use the increased volume and breadth of data to analyse and predict
2. Definitions
  - Not just about volume but also approach to collection, processing and use
  - Big Data
    - like an ocean, vast with unexplored areas
  - Small Data
    - Lake, crystal clear, smaller and easier to navigate

  >  In our modern, data-driven world, understanding the difference between these two types of data is crucial. 
It's not just about the amount of data we're dealing with but also about the tools, techniques, and strategies we use to handle it. 
Whether it's a small business analysing customer feedback (Small Data) or a multinational corporation processing millions of transactions per day (Big Data), the way we approach these datasets can have a profound impact on our insights and decisions.
## Data Characteristics - 5 V's of Big Data
1. Volume
   - typically terabytes and above, challenges to storage and processing
2. Variety
  - types, sources, structured, unstructured, semi structured, different formats
3.  Velocity
    - speed of collection, generated and processed. Often streamed from various sources requiring real (or near real) time processing
4. Veracity
  - reliability, trustworthiness and accuracy. Often contains noisy, incomplete or erroeous data. Significant challenge
5. Value
  - Potential insights and benefits through advanced analytics, predictive modelling, and data-driven decision-making. 
## Fundamentals of Data
1. Volume
  - Byte (B) - 8 bits - single character
  - Kilobyte (KB) 1024 Bytes - short paragraph
  - Megabyte (MB) 1024 KB - ~ 43 3 page word documents
  - Gigabyte (GB) 1024 GB - 20 minute DVD
  - Terabyte (TB) - 1024 GB
  - Petabyte (PB) - 1024 TB - 13.3 yrs HD Video/ 250000 humans DNA
  - Exabyte (EB) - 1024 PB - 5 yrs of internet traffic
  - Zettabyte (ZB)
  - Yottabyte (YB)
2. Types
  - Binomial - One of 2 values
  - Nominal - Named data eg countries, colours. Segmentation or categorisation
  - Ordinal - has an order eg small, medium, large
  - Qualitative - anything not described as a number
  - Quantitative - anything described as a number
  - Discrete - Anything that can be counted
  - Continuous - Anything that is measured eg weight, height, distance, time 
3. External Data
  - Open & Public - Government published dat such as census data
  - Administrative Data - Data collected by organisations for operational purposes, record keeping or to track performance.
  - Research Data -
  - External data -
