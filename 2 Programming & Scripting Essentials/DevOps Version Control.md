Distributed version control systems (DVCS), such as GIT, allow each developer to have a local copy of the entire repository. This feature facilitates collaboration as developers can work on their own repository and then synchronise with others
## What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control solution. It stores your code in a repository. You can have multiple repositories and share them with colleagues.

For data engineers, version control extends beyond code. It includes managing configuration files, SQL scripts, and data pipeline definitions. 

By using VCS, data engineers can maintain a history of changes, collaborate more effectively with team members, and ensure that data processing tasks are consistent and reproducible.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) 

Continuous Integration (CI) involves frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, where automated tests validate the changes. Continuous Deployment (CD) automates the release of validated changes to production. For data engineers, CI/CD pipelines automate the deployment of data products, ensuring they are tested and released rapidly and reliably.
