# What are containers for?
A container is an application, including all its dependencies, libraries and other binaries, and the configuration files needed to run it, bundled into a single package that can be moved, in total, from one computing environment to another. It can be used to get around differences in operating systems, software versions, infrastructure, security protocols, and storage.
# What is Virtualisation
An entire machine is replicated often icluding the OS. Several GB's in size
Need dedicated memory and storage
# How did we get here
Applications run differently on different machines
Docker - Standardised way to up into containers
Kubernetes - Way to manage & automated containers
Serverless Computing - Introduced by AWS Lambda in 2014, serverless architectures enable applications to scale automatically in response to demand, promoting efficient resource usage and supporting sustainability objectives.

# Serverless Mode vs. the VM Deployment Model
## What are the advantages of Containerisation
Smaller size than Virtualisation
Shared resources rather than dedicated
Scalable & efficient
Flexible & Portable
Suitable for Cloud computing

## What are the disadvantages of Containerisation
Less secure than VM
Suseptable to data leaks through security flaws

## What are the advantages of VM
Secure - isolation between VMs

## What are the disadvantages of VM
Slower deplyment
Higher overheads
